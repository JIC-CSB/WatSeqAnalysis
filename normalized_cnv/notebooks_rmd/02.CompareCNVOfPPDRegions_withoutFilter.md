Analysis of CNV for PPD genes
================

This notebook is to include the analysis of:

1.  The SD of the 823 lines
2.  Comparing the deletions from the raw coverages and from the
    normalized coverage (PPD1-2A)
3.  Details of clusters 5 of TraesCS4D01G040100

## Distribution of the SD across all the lines.

To prepare the `libSD.csv.gz` I used the following command:

``` sh
gunzip -c libSD.csv.gz |
  sed -e s/\"\",\"x\"/\"line\",\"SD\"/ -e s/merge\.rmdup\.// > libSD_short.csv
```

The following plot shows the distirbution of the Standard Deviation
after the normalization of all the samples..

## Comparing the deletions from the raw coverages and from the normalized coverage (PPD1-2A)

This is the distribution of all coverages in the region
`chr2A_part1:36931000-36943300`. The windows on the normalised table are
not the same as in the ppd example in the XLS file, as the window size
is different and we only consider +/- 2kpb around the gene model. The
plots in the top contains all the normalised values for all the windows
in the range. The plots on the bottom is the distribution of the values
on lines `WATDE0027`, `WATDE0164` and `WATDE0165`, which are in the
cluster 1 of TraesCS2A01G081900.Ppd-1.png, but have a longer deletion
than the rest of of the values. We are including also `WATDE0141` as it
was requested by Simon On the left, the values normalized by line and
window. On the right, the raw data from the excel file with PPD1-2A. In
the case of line `WATDE0141`, the absolute coverage seems to be low, but
after normalisation it is clear that deletion looks more like a copied
region. This may be real, or it may be an issue of the region having a
low mapping in general. This mau need validation in the lab.

To explore in more detail those three lines, we had a look at three
lines that seemed to have a longer deletion than the rest of the lines.
On the normalised example, the second, smaller deletion, is reduces. The
coverage distribution of the secondary deletion suggests that across all
the lines there is a low amplification, but consistent across all the
lines. This suggests that this deletion is likely to be artificial.
However, it would be intresting to validate it.

## Details of cluster 5 of TraesCS4D01G040100

Finally, looking at the plots we found that for `TB1-4D`, clusters 4 and
5 seem to have a duplication. For those, I don’t have the values from
the 100bp bins as with `PPD1-2A`.  
Hence, I only plotted the values for the normalisations we’d ben
producing. From the 6 lines in cluster 5 that passed the filters
(discussed above, to be relaxed), only `WATDE0821` seems to be
consistently around the 2X coverage.
