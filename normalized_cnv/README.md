# Normalized Coverage

This section contains the scripts used to calculate the normalized coverage. 
The ideas and code come from here: https://github.com/Uauy-Lab/bio.tilling. 
However, modifications on this code will be documented here. 

Each folder contains a general step for the analysis. 

1. Coverage_matrix. Generating the normalised coverage matrix. 
2. Prepare the outputs from the normalization to be loaded as an sqlite database


## Extra folders

```notebooks_rmd``` Has notebooks with preliminary analysis and QCs. This may be moved to the corresponding step later on.
