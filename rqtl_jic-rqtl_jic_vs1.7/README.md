# rqtl_jic

Scripts to run a semi-automised 'R/qtl' analysis if pre-formated genotype and phenotyp files are available in a pre-set
data directory (rqtl_data).
The scripts rely on the package 'qtl' in R software. Details at: https://rqtl.org/
Many thanks to Karl W Broman and Hao Wu and all other contributers for sharing their software and supporting the community for so many years.

Please read the Rqtl_JIC_qtl_mapping_manual_vs1.x.pdf for more details how to use the scripts.
