# WatSeqAnalysis
Analysis code and pipelines supporting the WatSeq project

Code should be deposited together with the instructions and extra information necessary to allow it to be reproduced (see instructions below). Code will be shared within the WatSeq project members with the understanding that it will be used solely for the purposes of the WatSeq project analyses as agreed with the project leads Griffiths and Cheng. All code will be made public at the time of publication of the analyses (e.g. main WatSeq ‘capstone’ paper) under the MIT license (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

As the pipelines develop, or new analyses are initiated, we expect that they will be developed within the repository. It should therefore remain an up to date representation of the code that is used to generate analyses that are part of the WatSeq project.

## Instructions for use

Within the root directory of the repository, please create a folder with the name of your analysis or pipeline. Within this folder, deposit your code, together with a README file. This should include the following information:
1. The author(s) of the code/pipeline.
2. A short outline of the analysis carried out by the code/pipeline.
3. What software dependencies are required to run the code, including specific version details as needed. Please also include links to those dependencies  if they are not in standard software repositories (e.g. CRAN for R code, PyPi  for Python etc).
4. Installation and use instructions for the code/pipeline.
